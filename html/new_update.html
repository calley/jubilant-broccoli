							[ This is an alert to notify you of the newest updates to Pandora Enhancer! ]
							</br></br>
							-IMPORTANT MESSAGE-</br>
							With the new "ColorPicker" feature came a few bugs. Your settings have been reset, as I noticed that some download features required a clean install of the extension in order to clean the settings. <i>This is no longer necessary</i>.
							</br></br>
							Downloads have been fixed, as well as all major functions of the extension. MacOS users should see the note I left in the "Options" page regarding notifications. If you see something wrong, please let me know on the extension's support page! Thank you for being patient.
							</br>
						</p>
						<h2>Thank you for continuing to use Pandora Enhancer!</h2>
